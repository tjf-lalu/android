I dont know to fix if you cannot gradle my files. It takes forever for me to gradle people's project, maybe different Android Studio version????
BIG UPDATE
https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/
 5/17/2017, Kotlin now official language for Android Studio :) I have not learn Kotlin yet, hope it will be fun
I have been learning java for over 1 year when this come, Kotlin is based on Java so these 2 languages will be developed parallely, hope so.
I will have a new branch, android-kotlin, for android apps written in kotlin, while still updating this branch as my old, obsolete project, huhu... Or maybe mix between them!

Welcome to my branch!
Click on every other branches to see the code
Please if you use any of the code or found something that didn't work as expected, email me: khainl1110@gmail.com
This branch is owned by a boy who not going sure about the future....
Enjoy!
